# Xuanfu Chen . Jarvis Consulting

As a recent computer science graduate from York University with a bachelor's degree, I have gained a strong foundation in fundamental concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and RDBMS. With two internships in full-stack development and my personal projects, I gained hands-on experience in developing web applications using various technologies such as HTML, CSS, AJAX, Java Servlets, Django, and Spring Boot. My first internship involved developing a job board website, where I gained insight into back-end business logic. My second internship involved developing a data visualization application using the Django framework. Additionally, I built a dynamic blog web application using Spring Boot, which demonstrated my strong coding and problem-solving skills. My passion for programming has driven me to build personal projects and continuously learn new technologies. With my education and experience, I am well prepared for a junior software engineer position and looking forward to starting a full-time career in this industry.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-xuanfuchen](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-xuanfuchen)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-xuanfuchen/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed and implemented monitoring system that contains multiple scripts to monitor and store the system specification and system resource usage across multiple Linux hosts and store data into a database. Configured and maintained the PostgreSQL Docker container to store and manage the collected data. Automated script execution with Crontab to fetch and store system resource usage in the database every minute for real-time data accuracy.

**SQL Project** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-xuanfuchen/tree/master/sql)]: Developed a comprehensive SQL project that includes the setup of a table schema using DDL, and multiple queries to perform various operations on an existing database. These operations include basic CRUD functionality, JOIN statements to combine data from multiple tables, and the use of aggregation functions to extract and summarize data. Demonstrated knowledge of SQL by manipulating string format and using various features to generate desired outputs.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-xuanfuchen/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed a Twitter App utilizing Java 8 and Maven with Spring Boot for efficient dependency management. Implemented a four-layer architecture consisting of DAO, Service, Controller, and Application layers to enhance code organization and scalability. Utilized Twitter API version 2 to enable users to create, read, and delete tweets via the Linux command line. Packaged the project into a Docker image and published it on Docker Hub for easy distribution and deployment.
  - JDBC App: Developed a Java 8 Maven-based application that uses the DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern and JDBC to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a PostgreSQL database. Enables users to perform common database operations efficiently. Employed the DAO design pattern to promote good coding practices and make the code more maintainable and extensible. Utilized a PostgreSQL database running inside a Docker container for easy deployment and management. Built the database schema and inserted data using SQL scripts.
  - Grep App: Built a Java 8 project with Maven for searching text lines that match a specific pattern in all files under a directory. Implemented two different search implementations, one using for loops and another using Java 8 Stream/Lambda functions for better performance. Utilized a logger library to provide feedback on the search process. Enabled the app to output search results to a file using Java IO APIs. Tested both implementations using JUnit and reached 89% coverage. Deployed the project in a Docker container and uploaded it to Docker Hub for easy distribution.


## Highlighted Projects
**Dynamic Blog Web Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/xuanfuchen/BlogProject)]: Developed an online blog system that enables administrators to perform CRUD operations on articles, tags, and types while logged in. Implemented a search feature that allows users to easily find articles by name, and a group feature that enables articles to be organized by type or tags for convenient browsing. Implemented a comment feature that enables users to leave comments on articles and reply to other comments. Built front-end pages using Semantic UI and Thymeleaf and leveraged Spring Boot for a reliable and scalable backend solution. Designed a MySQL schema by carefully defining objects and relations to ensure data integrity.
