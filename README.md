# Xuanfu Chen . Jarvis Consulting

I'm a recent graduate from York University with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I have a strong foundation in fundamental concepts like algorithms, data structures, and RDBMS. I had two internships before, both in full-stack development. In my first internship, I participated in the development of a job board website using HTML, CSS, AJAX, and Java Servlets for the back-end. In my second internship, I developed a data visualization application to visualize stock information for top companies using the Django framework. Also, I built a dynamic blog web application using Spring Boot where the blogger can use admin pages to manage the blogs. I have strong coding and problem-solving skills, as proven by my past experiences and personal projects. I have always been passionate about programming since I get a sense of achievement from optimizing code or fixing bugs. With my education and experience, I am well prepared for a junior software engineer position, and I am looking forward to starting my career in this industry full-time.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-xuanfuchen](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-xuanfuchen)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-xuanfuchen/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed and implemented monitoring system that contains multiple scripts to monitor and store the system specification and system resource usage across multiple Linux hosts. Utilized Crontab to automate the execution of scripts to ensure that the data in the database is accurate and up-to-date, system resource usage will be fetched and stored into the database at an interval of 1 minute.

**SQL Project** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-xuanfuchen/tree/master/sql)]: Developed a comprehensive SQL project that includes the setup of a table schema using DDL, and multiple queries to perform various operations on an existing database. These operations include basic CRUD functionality, JOIN statements to combine data from multiple tables, and the use of aggregation functions to extract and summarize data. Demonstrated knowledge of SQL by manipulating string format and using various features to generate desired outputs.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-xuanfuchen/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: In progress.
  - JDBC App: Developed a Java 8 Maven-based application that uses the DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern and JDBC to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a PostgreSQL database. Enables users to perform common database operations efficiently. Employed the DAO design pattern to promote good coding practices and make the code more maintainable and extensible. Utilized a PostgreSQL database running inside a Docker container for easy deployment and management. Built the database schema and inserted data using SQL scripts.
  - Grep App: In progress.


## Highlighted Projects
**Dynamic Blog Web Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/xuanfuchen/BlogProject)]: Built an online blog system that allows the blog administrators to log in and out and perform CRUD operations on articles, tags, and types. Implemented the search feature, the group feature, and the comment feature that allow users to search articles by name, group articles by type or tags, and comment on articles or other comments. Designed and built front-end pages using Semantic UI and Thymeleaf. Implemented the backend using Spring Boot. Designed objects and relations for generating the MySQL schema.
