# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary:  I'm a recent graduate from York University with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I have a strong foundation in fundamental concepts like algorithms, data structures, and RDBMS. I had two internships before, both in full-stack development. In my first internship, I participated in the development of a job board website using HTML, CSS, AJAX, and Java Servlets for the back-end. In my second internship, I developed a data visualization application to visualize stock information for top companies using the Django framework. Also, I built a dynamic blog web application using Spring Boot where the blogger can use admin pages to manage the blogs. I have strong coding and problem-solving skills, as proven by my past experiences and personal projects. I have always been passionate about programming since I get a sense of achievement from optimizing code or fixing bugs. With my education and experience, I am well prepared for a junior software engineer position, and I am looking forward to starting my career in this industry full-time.
