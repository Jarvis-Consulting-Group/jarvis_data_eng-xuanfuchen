summary:  I'm a recent graduate from York University with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I have a strong foundation in fundamental concepts like algorithms, data structures, and RDBMS. I had two internships before, both in full-stack development. In my first internship, I participated in the development of a job board website using HTML, CSS, AJAX, and Java Servlets for the back-end, where I learned how back-end business logic works. In my second internship, I developed a data visualization application to visualize stock information for top companies using the Django framework, where I learned how to work with the MVC model. Additionally, I built a dynamic blog web application using Spring Boot where the blogger can use admin pages to manage the blogs, and I was enjoying putting every component together and forming a working application. I have strong coding and problem-solving skills, as proven by my past experiences and personal projects. I have always been passionate about programming since I get a sense of achievement from building programs or optimizing codes. With my education and experience, I am well prepared for a junior software engineer position, and I am looking forward to starting my career in this industry full-time.

    description: Designed and implemented monitoring system that contains multiple scripts to monitor and store the system specification and system resource usage across multiple Linux hosts and store data into a database. Configured and maintained the PostgreSQL Docker container to store and manage the collected data. Automated script execution with Crontab to fetch and store system resource usage in the database every minute for real-time data accuracy.
  - name: "SQL Project"
    git_url: "/sql"
    description: Developed a comprehensive SQL project that includes the setup of a table schema using DDL, and multiple queries to perform various operations on an existing database. These operations include basic CRUD functionality, JOIN statements to combine data from multiple tables, and the use of aggregation functions to extract and summarize data. Demonstrated knowledge of SQL by manipulating string format and using various features to generate desired outputs.

      #   - "Twitter App: In progress."
      - "JDBC App: Developed a Java 8 Maven-based application that uses the DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern and JDBC to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a PostgreSQL database. Enables users to perform common database operations efficiently. Employed the DAO design pattern to promote good coding practices and make the code more maintainable and extensible. Utilized a PostgreSQL database running inside a Docker container for easy deployment and management. Built the database schema and inserted data using SQL scripts."
      - "Grep App: Built a Java 8 project with Maven for searching text lines that match a specific pattern in all files under a directory. Implemented two different search implementations, one using for loops and another using Java 8 Stream/Lambda functions for better performance. Utilized a logger library to provide feedback on the search process. Enabled the app to output search results to a file using Java IO APIs. Tested both implementations using JUnit and have an average coverage of 89%. Deployed the project in a Docker container and uploaded it to Docker Hub for easy distribution."
